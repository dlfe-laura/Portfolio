                My name is Laura and I was born in Spain. After finishing high school I decided I wanted to challenge myself and 
                study my Bachelor's degree abroad. I ended up in Groningen, The Netherlands, where I would obtain my undergraduate
                diploma in Physics in 2022. After my studies I joined the racing team Top Dutch Solar Racing as an 
                Electrical Engineer. In 2024, I started my Master's degree in Nanoscience in Lund University.
                <br><br>
                Aside from my educational and professional career, I advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and representation in STEM fields.
                One of my personal goals is to give voice and role models to the queer youth so science and engineering becomes more
                diverse.
