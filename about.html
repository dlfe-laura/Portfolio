            My name is Laura and I was born in Spain. After finishing high school I decided I wanted to challenge myself and 
            study my Bachelor's degree abroad. I ended up in Groningen, The Netherlands, where I would obtain my undergraduate
            diploma in Physics in 2022. After my studies I joined the racing team Top Dutch Solar Racing as an 
            Electrical Engineer. In 2024, I started my Master's degree in Nanoscience in Lund University.

            Aside from my educational and professional career, I advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and representation in STEM fields.
            One of my personal goals is to give voice and role models for the queer youth so science and engineering becomes more
            diverse.
