                    <p>VOICes Engineering & Science is a project that was born from the need of representation in STEM fields. As a co-founder of
                    the project, our aim was to give voice to LGBTQ+ online creators in fields of science and engineering. We strive for 
                    a more diverse future in academia and industry. The website allows anyone to search for LGBTQ+ creators from any
                    scientific field in diverse social media platforms.

                    <h3>Top Dutch Solar Racing</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was part of Top Dutch Solar Racing as an Electrical Engineer in their 2023 team. 
                        My responsabilities included the design, development, and manufacturing of the solar deck that powered the car 
                        for over 3000 km through the Australian desert. Our car, Green Thunder, competed in the Bridgestone World 
                        Solar Challenge 2023 and finished in 6th place. Notably, it was the first car in the world to compete using 
                        silicon-perovskite tandem solar cells. This pioneering solar deck was developed in collaboration with Oxford PV, 
                        the spin-off company from Oxford University.

                    <p>During my time in the team I also was partially involved in the communications team as a copywriter and scriptwriter.
                        I developed the concept YouTube series Tech Tuesday, in which we aimed to simplify solar racing concepts to reach
                        broader audiences.
