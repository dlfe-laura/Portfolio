                    <p>VOICes Engineering & Science is a project that was born from the need of representation in STEM fields. As a co-founder of
                    the project, our aim was to give voice to LGBTQ+ online creators in fields of science and engineering. We strive for 
                    a more diverse future in academia and industry. The website allows anyone to search for LGBTQ+ creators from any
                    scientific field in diverse social media platforms.

                    <h3>Top Dutch Solar Racing</h3>
                    <p>Top Dutch Solar Racing (TDSR) is a Dutch racing team from which I was part in Team 2023. I took the role of Electrical Engineer in
                        the team, being responsible of the design, development and building of the solar deck that would power the car for
                        more than 3000 km through the Australian desert. <i>Green Thunder</i>, the 2023 TDSR car, would compete in the Bridgestone 
                        World Solar Challenge 2023 and end in 6th position. This car was the first in the world to compete using 
                        silicon-perovskite tandem solar cells, as the solar deck was developed in collaboration with the Oxford University's 
                        spin-off company, Oxford PV.

                    <p>During my time in the team I also was partially involved in the communications team as a copywriter and scriptwriter.
                        I developed the concept YouTube series <i>Tech Tuesday</i> in which we aimed to simplify solar racing concepts to reach
                        broader audiences.
